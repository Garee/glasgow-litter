              Welcome! This is an interactive visualisation of litter on the
              streets of Glasgow City. It is part of a research project which

              A neural network based object detection model has been applied to
              thousands of Google Street View images. Those images in which
              litter has been detected are marked on this map.

              Each ward contains many data zones which are outlined in black.
              The 746 data zones are used to create a relative measure of
