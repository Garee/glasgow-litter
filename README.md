# Glasgow Litter ðŸš¯

A research project that explores the relationships between deprivation and litter in Glasgow City.

## Objectives

1. Identify the relationships between the key indicators of deprivation in areas of
   Glasgow City and the amount of litter on its streets.
2. Discover if an automated approach to counting litter on a city scale could be achieved using deep learning object detection methods.

## Data

The project's data sources can be found in the `data` directory and are described in [DATA.md](docs/DATA.md).

## App

A companion [web application](https://glasgow-litter.garyblackwood.co.uk) is included that allows users to interactively explore the litter objects detected throughout the city.

More information can be found in [APP.md](docs/APP.md).

## Object Detection

The notebooks in the `models/yolov5` directory are used to develop YOLOv5s object detection models for the purposes of litter detection.

Similarly, the notebooks in the `models/detectron2` directory are used to train Faster R-CNN models with the same objective.

## Regression

The notebook in the `regression` directory applies count data regression models such as Poisson and Negative Binomial to the extended SIMD data set described in [DATA.md](docs/DATA.md).

## Clone

This repository contains two submodules as dependencies. Use the following command to clone this repository and the submodules it references:

```bash

## Scripts

There are utility scripts within the `scripts` directory that can be used for data collection and preparation.

More information can be found in the header comment of each script.

## Report

The source code for the report can be found in the `report` directory. This is currently a work in progress.
